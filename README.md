## Description

A visual representation of the Lorenz Attractor. The Lorenz Attractor is, in lateman's terms: the Butterfly Effect, or the mathmatical formula of natural chaos. The Butterfly Effect's name may come from the visual attractor eventually forming a shape vaguely reminescient of a butterfly's wings.

Mathmatical Formulas (Lorenz Equations) used for this Model:
